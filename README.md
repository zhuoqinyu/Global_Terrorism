"Terrorism " is a subject of great importance and a problem worldwide. Herein, this project's goal is to provide a report to help the audience better understand the pattern of global terrorism attacks. The study is based on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2016, consisting of more than 170,000 terrorist attacks. Some exploratory data analysis has done on the dataset to show the distribution of both fatal and non-fatal terrorism attacks worldwide. It is found that terrorism mostly affects areas that are more densely populated. When it comes to America, it is discovered that California and New York are the two states mostly affected by terrorism. With this well-maintained dataset, a lot more thorough studies can be done. We can do more analysis including time series statistical overview, the actors of terrorism attacks. More detailed classification of attacks can be done as well.
